​Privacy Policy 
The Network Theory Applied Research Institute, Inc. ("NTARI") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you interact with our website (NTARI.org), participate in our programs, or communicate with us through various channels.



Special Notice for Parents: If you are considering allowing your child (under 18) to participate in NTARI programs or use our platforms, please review our comprehensive Children's Privacy and Parental Guidance section below, which includes important safety recommendations for protecting your child's privacy and ensuring appropriate supervision of their online activities.



This policy implements the comprehensive data protection standards established in NTARI Bylaws Article IX and demonstrates our commitment to privacy-first operations that serve community needs without surveillance or commercial exploitation.


IMPORTANT: Third-Party Platform Notice
NTARI.org is built on the Wix platform. When you use our website and Member Channel, you are subject to both NTARI's privacy protections AND Wix's data collection practices.


What This Means for You
Dual Privacy Policies Apply:

NTARI's Privacy Policy (this document) governs how NTARI handles your information

Wix's Privacy Policy governs how Wix collects and processes your data as the platform provider



Data Collection Beyond NTARI's Control: When you visit NTARI.org or use our Member Channel, Wix automatically collects:

IP addresses and location data

Browser type, version, and device information

Website usage analytics and behavioral data

Cookies and tracking technologies

Technical performance data



NTARI's Limited Control:

We cannot prevent Wix from collecting this data

We cannot control how Wix uses, stores, or shares this information

We cannot provide user rights (access, deletion, etc.) for data held by Wix

Wix's data practices may change independently of NTARI's policies


Your Privacy Choices
Review Wix's Privacy Policy: You can find Wix's current privacy policy at https://www.wix.com/about/privacy



Platform Alternatives: We are evaluating migration to more privacy-focused platforms and welcome community input on this priority



Contact Us: If you have specific concerns about third-party data collection, contact our Privacy Officer at info@ntari.org



Enhanced Protections: NTARI implements additional privacy safeguards within our technical capabilities, but cannot override Wix's fundamental platform data collection


Article IX Bylaws Implementation
This Privacy Policy operates under the comprehensive data protection framework established in NTARI Bylaws Article IX, ensuring:


Privacy by Design Architecture
All NTARI systems incorporate privacy protections at the architectural level rather than as optional features, ensuring baseline protection cannot be circumvented by users, administrators, or external pressures, within the constraints of our current platform infrastructure.


Prohibited Practices
NTARI formally prohibits:

Commercial Data Exploitation: No monetization of user data or behavioral information by NTARI

Surveillance Integration: No voluntary cooperation with surveillance systems beyond legally required compliance

Discriminatory Profiling: No categorization or targeting based on protected characteristics by NTARI

Voluntary Law Enforcement Collaboration: Cooperation only when compelled by valid legal process, with user notification when legally permissible


Enhanced Community Protections
Community members facing heightened surveillance risks receive additional technical safeguards and policy protections appropriate to their specific risk profiles, with individual risk assessment options available without requiring disclosure of specific vulnerability categories.

Account Information: Name, email address, and other details you provide when joining our Member Channel or participating in volunteer programs

Communication Data: Information shared through messages, emails, or other correspondence with NTARI

Volunteer Information: Time tracking data, project participation, and contributions to NTARI programs

Wix Data Practices: NTARI does not control Wix's collection, use, storage, or sharing of this information. Refer to Wix's privacy policy for details about their data practices.


Data Minimization Principle - Clarified
NTARI minimizes data collection that we directly control to what is necessary for educational functionality and legal compliance. However, users should understand that platform providers like Wix collect additional data beyond NTARI's control. Users maintain control over data within NTARI's systems, but have limited control over third-party platform data collection.


How We Collect Information

Direct Submission to NTARI
Information you voluntarily provide when joining our channels, volunteering, or contacting NTARI, including governance participation and community contribution activities.


Platform-Mediated Collection
Through Wix Platform: When you use NTARI.org, Wix automatically collects technical and usage data according to their privacy policy. NTARI receives limited analytics data from Wix but does not control the full scope of Wix's data collection.



Third-Party Integration: Information provided through other platforms we use for meetings (e.g., Zoom) or communications (e.g., WhatsApp, Spaces App). Each platform has its own data collection practices beyond NTARI's control.


Community Interaction
Information shared through community participation, peer review processes, collective intelligence activities, and democratic governance participation, with appropriate privacy protections for all community interactions within NTARI's technical capabilities.
