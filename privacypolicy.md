Privacy Policy - Updated 7/2/2025
The Network Theory Applied Research Institute, Inc. ("NTARI") is committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect information when you interact with our website (NTARI.org), participate in our programs, or communicate with us through various channels.

Special Notice for Parents: If you are considering allowing your child (under 18) to participate in NTARI programs or use our platforms, please review our comprehensive Children's Privacy and Parental Guidance section below, which includes important safety recommendations for protecting your child's privacy and ensuring appropriate supervision of their online activities.

This policy implements the comprehensive data protection standards established in NTARI Bylaws Article IX and demonstrates our commitment to privacy-first operations that serve community needs without surveillance or commercial exploitation.

 

Article IX Bylaws Implementation
This Privacy Policy operates under the comprehensive data protection framework established in NTARI Bylaws Article IX, ensuring:

Privacy by Design Architecture
All NTARI systems incorporate privacy protections at the architectural level rather than as optional features, ensuring baseline protection cannot be circumvented by users, administrators, or external pressures.

Prohibited Practices
NTARI formally prohibits:

Commercial Data Exploitation: No monetization of user data or behavioral information

Surveillance Integration: No voluntary cooperation with surveillance systems beyond legally required compliance

Discriminatory Profiling: No categorization or targeting based on protected characteristics

Voluntary Law Enforcement Collaboration: Cooperation only when compelled by valid legal process, with user notification when legally permissible

Enhanced Community Protections
Community members facing heightened surveillance risks receive additional technical safeguards and policy protections appropriate to their specific risk profiles, with individual risk assessment options available without requiring disclosure of specific vulnerability categories.
