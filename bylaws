# BYLAWS OF NETWORK THEORY APPLIED RESEARCH INSTITUTE, INC.
A Nonprofit Corporation - Revised Edition with Data Protection Amendment

## INTRODUCTION TO GOVERNANCE

The Network Theory Applied Research Institute (NTARI) operates as a research and development organization focused on creating systems that enhance online cooperation. These bylaws establish a governance framework designed to support our mission while maintaining the flexibility needed for a growing organization driven by volunteer expertise and collaborative innovation.

Our governance structure recognizes that effective nonprofit organizations balance democratic accountability with operational efficiency. As a small but ambitious organization, we emphasize clear roles, practical procedures, and sustainable growth rather than complex administrative overhead that could divert resources from our core mission.

## ARTICLE I: MISSION AND PURPOSES

NTARI is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and scientific purposes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The organization develops systems, protocols, and programs for online global cooperatives inspired by network theory, focusing on digital infrastructure that enhances human cooperation and collective intelligence.

Our work encompasses research into network science applications, development of cooperative software systems, and education about collaborative technologies. All activities serve the public benefit by advancing knowledge about effective online cooperation and creating tools that communities can use to organize more effectively.

NTARI does not engage in political campaigning or substantial lobbying activities as prohibited under Section 501(c)(3) regulations, ensuring our research and development efforts maintain their educational and scientific focus.

## ARTICLE II: MEMBERSHIP

### Understanding NTARI Membership

Membership in NTARI provides the foundation for our democratic governance and community engagement. Members participate in organizational decision-making, program development, and the collaborative research that drives our mission forward.

### Section 2.1: Membership Eligibility and Benefits

Voting membership is open to anyone who joins our Member Channel at https://www.ntari.org/group-page/ntari-members/discussion and pays the monthly membership fee of fifty dollars ($50). This fee structure ensures sustainable operations while providing substantial value through access to research tools, community participation, and governance rights.

### Section 2.2: Membership Structure

NTARI maintains a single category of voting membership. All members possess equal rights to participate in board elections, serve in organizational roles, contribute to policy development, and represent NTARI when authorized by the board.

Members may resign by leaving the member channel or discontinuing fee payment. The board may terminate membership by majority vote only in cases involving illegal activities, ethical violations, or behavior substantially harmful to the organization's mission or community.

### Section 2.3: Annual Membership Meetings

The organization holds an Annual Membership Meeting each January to review organizational activities, receive reports on program progress and financial status, elect board members in accordance with the established rotation schedule, and address any policy matters requiring member input.

The meeting takes place via accessible digital platforms with details published at https://ntari.org/events. All voting members receive notice at least two weeks in advance with agenda items and any proposals requiring member action.

### Section 2.4: Quorum and Voting

A quorum for membership meetings consists of at least twenty-five percent of current voting members or ten members, whichever is smaller. Once established, the quorum remains valid for the duration of the meeting including any adjournments.

All membership votes require a simple majority of members present and voting unless these bylaws specify otherwise. Members may participate in meetings and voting through secure digital platforms when authorized by the board, with such participation carrying equivalent weight to in-person attendance.

## GOVERNANCE TRANSITION: FROM MEMBERSHIP TO BOARD LEADERSHIP

NTARI's governance structure reflects our commitment to democratic accountability while enabling the operational efficiency needed for effective mission delivery. Members exercise ultimate authority through elections and policy approval, while the elected Board of Directors provides strategic oversight and enables day-to-day operations through qualified Program Directors.

This balance ensures that member interests guide organizational direction while technical expertise and program knowledge inform implementation decisions. The following governance framework establishes clear accountability relationships while preserving the flexibility needed for volunteer-driven innovation and collaborative research.

## ARTICLE III: BOARD OF DIRECTORS

### Understanding Board Leadership

The Board of Directors provides strategic oversight and accountability for NTARI's mission while enabling the operational flexibility needed for effective program management. Understanding how member participation connects to board accountability helps clarify why this governance structure serves both democratic principles and practical effectiveness.

### Section 3.1: Board Composition and Roles

The Board consists of five elected positions: Chairman of the Board, President, Vice President, Secretary, and Treasurer. All positions serve two-year terms with elections held on a rotating schedule to ensure continuity while maintaining regular accountability to the membership.

The Chairman facilitates board meetings and provides governance leadership. The President manages overall operations and serves as the primary organizational representative. The Vice President assists the President and assumes presidential duties when needed. The Secretary maintains organizational records and manages communications. The Treasurer oversees financial management and reporting with appropriate professional qualifications.

### Section 3.2: Board Responsibilities

The board establishes organizational policy and strategic direction while delegating operational management to qualified Program Directors operating within approved charter parameters. Directors ensure NTARI's activities align with its mission and legal requirements, oversee financial management and resource allocation within board-approved budgets, hire and evaluate Program Directors, approve program charters and charter modifications, and maintain accountability to members through regular reporting and democratic processes.

Board members exercise collective governance authority while respecting the operational autonomy granted to Program Directors within their approved charters. This balance enables responsive decision-making without micromanaging the expertise that drives our programs forward.

### Section 3.3: Election and Terms

Board elections occur during Annual Membership Meetings with a rotating schedule that prevents wholesale board changes. Members may nominate candidates including themselves, with nominations requiring support from at least two voting members.

Elections use majority vote with runoffs if necessary when more than two candidates seek a position. Newly elected directors assume office immediately following the meeting and serve until their successors are elected and qualified.

### Section 3.4: Board Meetings and Decision-Making

The board meets quarterly with additional meetings called by the Chairman or President as needed. Meetings may occur in person or through secure digital platforms with all directors receiving at least one week's notice including agenda items.

A majority of board members constitutes a quorum for conducting business. The board makes decisions by majority vote of those present unless these bylaws require otherwise. Directors may participate in meetings and vote through digital platforms when authorized by board policy.

### Section 3.5: Vacancies and Removal

Vacancies on the board are filled by majority vote of remaining directors, with appointed members serving until the next regular election. Any board member may be removed by a two-thirds vote of the membership at any properly noticed meeting.

Directors may resign by written notice to the board, with resignations taking effect immediately unless a later date is specified.

## ARTICLE IV: OPERATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND PROGRAM CHARTER FRAMEWORK

### Understanding Program Management

Operational leadership in NTARI reflects our understanding that effective nonprofit organizations balance expertise-driven program management with democratic oversight. The following framework establishes how program expertise translates into authorized action while maintaining accountability to our member community.

### Section 4.1: Program Directors

Program Directors oversee designated organizational programs within the scope of their board-approved charters, providing strategic leadership and ensuring program activities align with organizational mission, charter parameters, and board policies.

#### Authority and Scope
Program Directors operate within the scope of their approved charters and may employ and distribute resources in accordance with their charter provisions, these bylaws, and board policies. This authority includes:

- Developing program strategies within charter-approved parameters
- Managing program budgets within board-approved allocations
- Hiring and supervising program staff and volunteers as authorized by charter
- Coordinating with other organizational programs and external partners
- Ensuring program compliance with organizational policies and legal requirements

#### Accountability Framework
Program Directors report directly to the board through quarterly reports documenting program activities, resource utilization, achievement of charter objectives, and any challenges requiring board attention or charter modification.

The board maintains oversight through charter compliance review rather than operational micromanagement, enabling Program Directors to exercise professional judgment within established boundaries while ensuring accountability for mission achievement and resource stewardship.

### Section 4.2: Resident Directors

Resident Directors manage specialized units within programs, such as subsidiary organizations, specific projects, or operational components requiring focused expertise. Program Directors recommend Resident Director appointments to the board for approval.

Resident Directors report to their designated Program Director while maintaining specialized focus on their assigned units. They manage day-to-day operations within their specialization, ensure compliance with applicable regulations including those governing subsidiary entities, coordinate with program leadership on integration and resource needs, and provide regular reporting on unit performance and needs.

### Section 4.3: Program Charter Development and Approval

#### Charter Purpose and Framework
Program charters define the mission, scope, operational parameters, and resource authority for major organizational initiatives. Charters provide Program Directors with clear operational boundaries while establishing accountability measures and board oversight requirements.

#### Charter Development Process
Program Directors are responsible for authoring and maintaining their program charters under board approval. The charter development process follows these steps:

**Draft Development**: Program Directors develop initial charter drafts addressing mission alignment, operational scope, resource requirements, governance structure, success metrics, and compliance requirements.

**Community Input Period**: Draft charters are published for member review through designated platforms for a minimum 14-day period, allowing community feedback and suggestions for improvement.

**Board Review and Revision**: Following community input, Program Directors may revise drafts before formal board consideration. The board reviews charters for mission alignment, resource feasibility, legal compliance, and operational clarity.

**Approval Requirement**: Charter approval requires majority vote of the Board of Directors. Approved charters establish the operational framework within which Program Directors exercise authority.

**Implementation and Modification**: Program Directors operate within approved charter parameters. Charter modifications follow the same development and approval process as initial charters.

#### Charter Content Requirements
All program charters must clearly define:
- Program mission and its alignment with NTARI's organizational mission
- Operational scope and boundaries of Program Director authority
- Resource allocation authority and budget parameters
- Reporting requirements and accountability measures
- Success metrics and evaluation criteria
- Compliance requirements and risk management protocols

### Section 4.4: Resource Allocation Authority Framework

#### Board Authority
- Approve annual budgets and major resource allocations
- Establish spending limits and approval thresholds within charters
- Review quarterly financial reports and program performance
- Modify charter resource authorities through majority vote

#### Program Director Authority (within approved charters)
- Allocate charter-approved budgets across program activities
- Make purchasing decisions within charter-specified limits
- Hire contractors and staff within budget and charter parameters
- Reallocate resources between charter-approved activities without board approval

#### Approval Thresholds
- Individual expenditures over $5,000 require board approval regardless of charter authority
- New budget categories not specified in charters require board approval
- Multi-year commitments exceeding charter timeline require board approval
- Any resource allocation affecting other programs requires inter-program coordination

#### Quarterly Reporting Integration
Program Directors submit quarterly reports documenting resource utilization, budget variance explanations, and any resource needs requiring charter modification or board approval. This reporting enables board oversight of resource stewardship without requiring advance approval of routine operational decisions within charter parameters.

## OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK INTEGRATION: FROM ROLES TO CHARTERS

Program Directors exercise their authority through approved charters that define both opportunities and boundaries for program innovation. This charter-based approach enables entrepreneurial program leadership while ensuring alignment with organizational mission and responsible resource stewardship.

The charter development process creates a collaborative framework where Program Directors can propose ambitious initiatives while receiving board guidance on feasibility, compliance, and integration with other organizational activities. Once approved, charters provide Program Directors with clear authority to pursue their program vision while establishing accountability measures that protect both organizational resources and mission integrity.

This integration of operational autonomy with governance oversight reflects NTARI's commitment to both democratic accountability and effective program delivery, enabling our volunteer leaders to pursue innovative approaches while maintaining the coordination needed for organizational coherence.

## ARTICLE V: CONFLICT OF INTEREST

### Section 5.1: Policy Purpose

This policy protects NTARI's interests when considering transactions that might benefit board members or key staff personally, ensuring decisions serve the organization's mission rather than private interests.

### Section 5.2: Disclosure Requirements

Board members and Program Directors must disclose any potential conflicts of interest when they arise. Interested parties must recuse themselves from related discussions and votes while the board determines whether a conflict exists and how to proceed.

### Section 5.3: Decision Process

The board evaluates potential conflicts by determining whether more advantageous alternatives exist and whether proposed transactions serve the organization's best interests. Decisions require majority vote of disinterested directors with appropriate documentation of the decision process.

## ARTICLE VI: FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT

### Section 6.1: Fiscal Year

NTARI's fiscal year begins January 1st and ends December 31st, aligning with calendar year reporting requirements and member meeting schedules.

### Section 6.2: Financial Oversight

The Treasurer manages day-to-day financial operations while the board maintains oversight through quarterly financial reviews and annual budget approval. The organization maintains appropriate financial controls including expense approval procedures and regular reconciliation of accounts.

### Section 6.3: Audit and Transparency

The board ensures appropriate financial transparency through regular reporting to members and compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. External audits may be conducted when required by law or deemed appropriate by the board.

## ARTICLE VII: AMENDMENTS

### Section 7.1: Amendment Process

These bylaws may be amended by majority vote of the membership at any properly noticed Annual or Special Membership Meeting. Proposed amendments must be provided to members at least two weeks before the meeting where they will be considered.

### Section 7.2: Board Recommendations

While members hold ultimate authority over bylaws amendments, the board may provide recommendations about proposed changes including analysis of legal, operational, or financial implications.

## ARTICLE VIII: NON-DISCRIMINATION POLICY

NTARI prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, disability, or other protected characteristics. The organization is committed to creating an inclusive environment that welcomes diverse perspectives and contributions to our collaborative mission.

All members, volunteers, and staff deserve respect and equal treatment. Violations of this policy may result in membership termination or other appropriate action as determined by the board.

## ARTICLE IX: COMPREHENSIVE DATA PROTECTION AND PRIVACY RIGHTS

### Section 9.1: Policy Foundation and Organizational Commitment

The Network Theory Applied Research Institute recognizes that effective cooperative systems require robust privacy protections and user data sovereignty. In alignment with our mission to develop systems that enhance human cooperation, NTARI commits to implementing comprehensive data protection standards that exceed minimum legal requirements and prioritize user rights over organizational convenience.

This policy establishes binding organizational commitments that apply to all NTARI systems, programs, and partnerships, ensuring our cooperative technologies serve communities without creating surveillance vectors or data exploitation risks.

### Section 9.2: Fundamental Data Protection Principles

NTARI operates under the following binding principles:

**Data Minimization**: NTARI shall minimize data collection to what is necessary for core functionality and legal compliance, including data automatically collected by platform providers. Users shall receive clear information about what data is gathered, how it is used, and how long it is retained.

**User Sovereignty**: Users maintain ultimate control over their data including rights to access, correct, export, and delete their information. These rights may not be waived through terms of service or other agreements.

**Purpose Limitation**: Data collected for specific purposes may not be used for other purposes without explicit user consent. This prohibition applies to all internal uses, external partnerships, and future system developments.

**Transparency by Design**: All data collection, processing, and sharing practices must be clearly documented in accessible language with regular updates provided to users when practices change.

### Section 9.3: Prohibited Data Practices

NTARI formally prohibits the following organizational practices across all programs and systems:

**Commercial Data Exploitation**: NTARI shall not sell, license, or monetize user data. This prohibition includes location information, behavioral patterns, communication content, and derived analytical insights about users.

**Surveillance Integration**: NTARI systems shall not integrate with surveillance technologies designed to monitor user behavior beyond voluntary self-reporting, track individual productivity, or enable third-party monitoring of user activities.

**Discriminatory Profiling**: NTARI shall not develop or deploy systems that profile users for discriminatory purposes including immigration status verification, creditworthiness assessment, or employment eligibility screening.

**Law Enforcement Collaboration**: NTARI shall not voluntarily share user data with law enforcement agencies except when compelled by valid legal process. When legally compelled, NTARI shall notify affected users when legally permissible and challenge overly broad requests.

### Section 9.4: Enhanced Protections for Vulnerable Communities

Recognizing that certain user communities face heightened surveillance and exploitation risks, NTARI implements enhanced protections based on risk assessment rather than demographic categorization:

**Economic Vulnerability**: Users in economically precarious situations receive enhanced protection against data practices that could affect employment, housing, or access to essential services.

**Legal Status Vulnerability**: Users who may face legal consequences from data exposure receive additional protections against information sharing that could result in enforcement actions or legal jeopardy.

**Community-Based Risk**: Communities that demonstrate heightened surveillance exposure or historical targeting receive enhanced technical safeguards and policy protections appropriate to their specific risk profile.

**Individual Risk Assessment**: Users may request enhanced protections based on personal circumstances without requiring disclosure of specific vulnerability categories.

### Section 9.5: Federated System Autonomy and Resistance Rights

Under NTARI's decentralized system architecture, particularly the Agrinet protocol:

**Node Autonomy**: Regional and local nodes maintain absolute authority to reject data sharing requests from third parties including government agencies, corporate entities, and other organizations regardless of claimed authority.

**Technical Resistance**: Federated nodes may implement technical and policy measures to resist surveillance requests, with NTARI providing technical guidance, legal resources, and infrastructure support when possible.

**Data Sovereignty**: Local communities operating NTARI systems retain sovereignty over their data and may establish data governance policies more restrictive than this organizational baseline.

**Federation Standards**: While respecting node autonomy, NTARI establishes minimum privacy standards for systems using NTARI protocols, ensuring baseline protections across the federated network.

### Section 9.6: Technical Implementation Requirements

All NTARI-developed systems must implement data protection through:

**Privacy by Design**: Privacy protections shall be incorporated at the architectural level rather than as optional features, ensuring baseline protection cannot be easily circumvented by users, administrators, or external pressures.

**Encryption Standards**: User data shall be protected through end-to-end encryption where technically feasible, secure storage with appropriate access controls, and communication protocols that resist interception.

**Anonymization and Pseudonymization**: Where possible, systems shall operate using anonymized or pseudonymized data, with clear technical barriers preventing re-identification of users.

**Data Retention Limits**: Clear policies establish maximum data retention periods with automatic deletion procedures. Users may request immediate deletion regardless of retention schedules.

**Audit and Monitoring**: Systems implement logging and audit capabilities that detect unauthorized access attempts while protecting user privacy through anonymized monitoring where possible.

### Section 9.7: User Rights and Empowerment

NTARI guarantees the following user rights:

**Access and Transparency**: Users may request complete information about data collected, processing activities, sharing arrangements, and storage practices affecting their information.

**Correction and Control**: Users may correct inaccurate information, modify privacy settings, and restrict data processing activities that exceed their comfort level.

**Portability**: Users may export their data in machine-readable formats for migration to other systems or personal archival purposes.

**Deletion**: Users may request complete deletion of their data with confirmation of deletion provided within 30 days except where legal requirements mandate retention.

**Objection**: Users may object to specific data processing activities including automated decision-making, profiling, or sharing with third parties.

### Section 9.8: Organizational Governance and Enforcement

**Board Oversight**: The Board of Directors shall review compliance with this policy quarterly, ensure Program Directors implement appropriate safeguards, and authorize resources necessary for privacy protection implementation.

**Privacy Officer Role**: The Secretary shall serve as organizational Privacy Officer, responsible for privacy policy implementation, user rights coordination, and data protection compliance monitoring.

**Charter Integration**: All Program Directors must demonstrate compliance with this policy within their approved charters, including specific implementation plans, technical safeguards, and user rights procedures relevant to their programs.

**Member Enforcement**: Any NTARI member may report suspected violations to the Board, which shall investigate promptly and respond within 30 days with findings and corrective actions.

### Section 9.9: External Relationships and Partnerships

NTARI's data protection commitments apply to external relationships:

**Partnership Standards**: Third-party partnerships, integrations, and collaborations must meet NTARI's data protection standards or implement technical isolation preventing data sharing that violates this policy.

**Service Provider Requirements**: External service providers must contractually commit to NTARI's data protection standards and submit to appropriate oversight and audit procedures.

**Research Collaboration**: Academic and research partnerships must include data protection agreements ensuring user privacy receives equal priority with research objectives.

**Advocacy and Support**: NTARI may share anonymized, aggregated data with advocacy organizations and researchers when such sharing advances cooperative technology development without compromising individual privacy.

### Section 9.10: Public Accountability and Transparency

NTARI maintains public accountability through:

**Transparency Reports**: Annual public reports documenting data protection implementation, legal requests received, privacy incidents, and system improvements implemented.

**Community Engagement**: Regular consultation with user communities, privacy advocates, and affected populations about data protection effectiveness and needed improvements.

**Open Source Commitment**: Where possible, NTARI systems utilize open source technologies enabling community audit of privacy protections and collaborative improvement of security measures.

**Incident Response**: Prompt public disclosure of data breaches, unauthorized access incidents, or legal compulsions affecting user data, with detailed explanation of response measures and preventive improvements.

### Section 9.11: Legal Standing and Amendment

This policy establishes legally binding commitments that:

**Organizational Precedence**: In cases of conflict between this policy and other organizational policies, external pressures, or funding requirements, user privacy protection takes precedence except where federal law mandates specific compliance.

**Leadership Continuity**: These commitments bind NTARI regardless of changes in leadership, board composition, funding sources, or external partnerships.

**Amendment Process**: These protections may only be weakened through the bylaws amendment process requiring membership approval as specified in Article VII, ensuring democratic oversight of privacy policy changes.

**Mission Integration**: Data protection advances NTARI's core mission by ensuring cooperative technologies serve communities without creating exploitation vectors that undermine the trust necessary for effective cooperation.

### Section 9.12: Implementation and Transition

Following membership approval of this amendment:

**Immediate Implementation**: The Board shall designate the Secretary as Privacy Officer within 15 days and begin quarterly review procedures immediately.

**Program Compliance**: Program Directors shall submit privacy compliance plans within 90 days demonstrating how their programs will meet these standards.

**Public Documentation**: NTARI shall publish updated privacy policies and user rights information within 60 days, incorporating these commitments into all user-facing documentation.

**System Audits**: Technical audits of existing systems shall be completed within 180 days, with implementation plans for any necessary privacy enhancements.
