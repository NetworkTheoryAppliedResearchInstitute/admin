# NTARI BYLAWS - DEMOCRATIC LANGUAGE ANALYSIS & UPDATES
**Network Theory Applied Research Institute, Inc.**

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Current Status Assessment
Based on the available bylaws content from NTARI.org, the current bylaws already use predominantly neutral governance language. The document employs standard nonprofit governance terminology such as:

- **Voting procedures** rather than "democratic processes"
- **Board of Directors** rather than "democratic leadership"
- **Member elections** rather than "democratic elections"
- **Committee authority** rather than "democratic delegation"
- **Simple majority** rather than "democratic majority"

### Identified Language Review Areas

While the current bylaws appear to use neutral language, here are the areas that should be verified in the complete document for any potential democratic language instances:

## PROPOSED UPDATES (Preventive Standardization)
