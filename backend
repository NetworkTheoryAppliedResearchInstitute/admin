## Executive Summary

The NTARI Backend represents a fundamental reimagining of digital research collaboration, demonstrating how privacy-first community platforms can enable sophisticated cooperative research without surveillance capitalism business models. As a flagship initiative of the Network Society Program, this platform leverages Wix Groups infrastructure to create siloed research environments that facilitate open-source development, educational workshops, service coordination, and experimental cooperative projects.

Unlike conventional research platforms that monetize user data or interrupt workflows with advertising, the NTARI Backend operates on principles of data sovereignty, community self-governance, and mission-aligned resource allocation. This whitepaper documents our approach to building research infrastructure that serves community needs rather than extractive business models, providing a replicable framework for organizations seeking alternatives to surveillance-based collaboration platforms.

## Introduction: Beyond Surveillance Capitalism in Research

Contemporary digital research collaboration occurs primarily through platforms designed for data extraction and behavioral monetization. Researchers, volunteers, and community members generate valuable intellectual labor while platform operators harvest behavioral data, social graphs, and content for commercial purposes. This extractive model fundamentally misaligns with cooperative research principles and creates systematic vulnerabilities for communities engaged in sensitive or innovative work.

The NTARI Backend emerges from recognition that effective cooperative research requires infrastructure designed specifically for community sovereignty rather than commercial extraction. By utilizing Wix Groups as a foundation while implementing strict privacy protections and community governance frameworks, we demonstrate practical alternatives to surveillance-based collaboration platforms.

## Network Society Program Context

### Mission Alignment

The Network Theory Applied Research Institute develops systems, protocols and programs for online global cooperatives inspired by network theory. The Network Society Program serves as NTARI's primary community engagement initiative, creating educational and research opportunities that advance cooperative technology development.

The NTARI Backend functions as both a practical research tool and a living demonstration of cooperative digital infrastructure principles. Through actual implementation rather than theoretical discussion, we provide evidence-based insights into privacy-first community platform development and governance.

### Community-Driven Research Philosophy

Our approach reflects network theory insights about distributed intelligence and emergent coordination. Rather than imposing hierarchical research structures, the NTARI Backend enables self-organizing research communities that develop organically around shared interests and complementary expertise.

The NTARI Backend utilizes Wix Groups' community management capabilities while implementing organizational policies that prioritize user sovereignty over platform convenience. This hybrid approach enables sophisticated collaboration features without requiring custom platform development, while maintaining control over data governance and community standards.

#### Group Structure and Privacy Implementation

The Groups API supports three privacy levels: PUBLIC (visible to all site visitors), PRIVATE (visible but requires join requests), and SECRET (invitation-only groups visible only to members). NTARI Backend groups primarily utilize PRIVATE and SECRET configurations to create appropriate research environments:

**Research Project Groups (SECRET)**: Sensitive research, grant development, and strategic planning occur in invitation-only environments where participants control information sharing and collaboration access.

**Educational Communities (PRIVATE)**: Open dialogue about organizational policies, procedures, and strategic direction occurs in transparent but membership-controlled environments.

**Public Engagement (PUBLIC)**: General information sharing and community outreach occurs in openly accessible spaces that welcome broader participation.

#### Data Sovereignty Implementation

NTARI prohibits commercial data exploitation, surveillance integration, discriminatory profiling, and law enforcement collaboration except when legally compelled. These commitments translate into specific technical and policy implementations:

**No Advertising Integration**: The NTARI Backend operates advertisement-free, eliminating behavioral tracking systems that compromise research privacy and community focus.

**Minimal Data Collection**: NTARI minimizes data collection to what is necessary for core functionality and legal compliance, with clear information about data gathering, usage, and retention.

**User Control**: Users maintain ultimate control over their data including rights to access, correct, export, and delete their information.

### Community Self-Governance Framework

#### Distributed Moderation

Group admins have the same permissions as site admins but only for their specific group, enabling distributed volunteer leadership within NTARI's program structure. This distributed authority structure reflects network theory principles while ensuring appropriate oversight and community standards maintenance.

Research communities develop their own participation guidelines within NTARI's broader policy framework, enabling specialized approaches that serve different research methodologies and collaboration styles.

#### Democratic Accountability

The Board of Directors reviews compliance with privacy policy quarterly, ensures Program Directors implement appropriate safeguards, and authorizes resources necessary for privacy protection implementation. This governance structure ensures community priorities guide platform development rather than commercial pressures.
